- **Best for**: Swing traders and position traders with multi-hour holds

### Position Sizing Recommendations

Given that approximately **40% of FVG get filled** within 5 candles:

1. **Conservative Approach**: Size positions assuming 40% failure rate
   - Use 50-60% of normal position size
   - Set stop-loss at FVG zone boundary

2. **Aggressive Approach (15m Bullish FVG only)**:
   - Use 70-80% of normal position size
   - Leverage the 64.6% success rate
   - Still use tight stop at FVG zone

3. **Diversification**:
   - Don't rely solely on FVG at 8:30
   - Combine with other confluence factors
   - Consider timeframe diversification

### Risk Management

**Stop-Loss Placement:**
- Place stop-loss at the opposite end of the FVG zone
- For bullish FVG: stop below the high of the 8:29 candle
- For bearish FVG: stop above the low of the 8:29 candle

**Profit Targets:**
- See FVG Max Excursion analysis for typical price movement distances
- 1m: Target 30-45 points for good FVG
- 5m: Target 50-80 points for good FVG
- 15m: Target 85-110 points for good FVG

### Entry Timing

**Confirmation Strategy:**
- Wait for the 3rd candle (8:31) to close before entering
- Verify FVG exists (gap between candles 1 and 3)
- Enter on the 4th candle (8:32 for 1m, 8:40 for 5m, 9:00 for 15m)

**Early Entry (Higher Risk)**:
- Enter during the 3rd candle if strong momentum
- Accept higher risk of false signals
- Use smaller position size

### Optimal Timeframe Selection

**For Bullish Bias Traders:**
- Prefer 15m timeframe (64.6% good rate)
- Secondary choice: 1m timeframe (59.7% good rate)
- Avoid 5m for bullish (only 56.8% good rate)

**For Bearish Bias Traders:**
- Prefer 5m timeframe (59.5% good rate)
- Secondary choice: 15m timeframe (58.2% good rate)
- 1m acceptable but slightly worse (56.5% good rate)

**For Unbiased/Systematic Traders:**
- Use 15m for best overall odds (61.6% good rate)
- Combine with directional filters or indicators
- Consider taking both bullish and bearish setups on 15m
